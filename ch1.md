### Chapter 1

It was a rainy Monday, worst than your usual Monday by at least two 
gallons worth. With a shiver and a sigh, a body stumbled past a door 
frame and into the first story apartment on a dead end street. 
Shaking the rain from his coat and coughing he brushed himself off. 

The entryway was narrow, and the small puddles around too many shoes 
were rapidly expanding as he stood there. Hanging his coat up and 
clearing his throat some more he worked off his boots and sighed. It 
had been a long day for him; the usual suspects of his bosses long 
nose over his shoulder, the editors who could't seem to keep their 
paperwork in order, and all the various disasters that seemed to 
accompany each of his days.

Exiting the hallway he walked through his kitchen, waving towards 
the back of his flatmates head. Hoping that he wouldn'tâ€”

"You have the rent today, Remy?"

"It's Monday Clark, you know I get paid Fridays, just like everyone 
else", he paused in his step and leaned back into the frame of the 
door. "Rent's not due until the end of week anyway, why're you on 
my case about it?" 

Clark had turned to face him, his hands clasping a large sub leaking
vinegar and an italian-looking assortment of meats and greens. His corn
colored hair was shaggy and hung down just past his chin. Mouth slowly
chewing away at the large bite he had just taken from his sandwich. Remy
stood, impatiently waiting for him to finish his mouthful. 

"Cause", he sniffed, "last time you were late" 

"I won't be this time, I've got a good story written already and the boss 
promised me the usual plus a little extra". Remy pushed off from the door's
frame and spun away. Walking down the hallway as Clark muttered something 
incoherent, but likely offensive. 

Navigating the narrow path through bundles of newspapers, books, and 
shelves, Remy fumbled with the key to his room in the dark. A moment 
of scratching later and he slipped into his room.
