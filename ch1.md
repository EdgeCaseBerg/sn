### Chapter 1

It was a rainy Monday, worst than your usual Monday by at least two 
gallons worth. With a shiver and a sigh, a body stumbled past a door 
frame and into the first story apartment on a dead end street. 
Shaking the rain from his coat and coughing he brushed himself off. 

The entryway was narrow, and the small puddles around too many shoes 
were rapidly expanding as he stood there. Hanging his coat up and 
clearing his throat, he worked off his boots and sighed. It 
had been a long day for him; the usual suspects of his bosses long 
nose over his shoulder, the editors who could't seem to keep their 
paperwork in order, and all the various disasters that seemed to 
accompany each of his days.

Exiting the hallway he walked through his kitchen, waving towards 
the back of his flatmates head. Hoping that he wouldn't—

"You have the rent today, Remy?"

"It's Monday Clark, you know I get paid Fridays, just like everyone 
else", he paused in his step and leaned back into the frame of the 
door. "Rent's not due until the end of week anyway, why're you on 
my case about it?" 

Clark had turned to face him, his hands clasping a large sub leaking
vinegar and an italian-looking assortment of meats and greens. His corn
colored hair was shaggy and hung down just past his chin. Mouth slowly
chewing away at the large bite he had just taken from his sandwich. Remy
stood, impatiently waiting for him to finish his mouthful. 

"Cause", he sniffed, "last time you were late" 

"I won't be this time, I've got a good story written already and the boss 
promised me the usual plus a little extra". Remy pushed off from the door's
frame and spun away. Walking down the hallway as Clark muttered something 
incoherent, but likely offensive. 

Navigating the narrow path through bundles of newspapers, books, and 
shelves, Remy fumbled with the key to his room in the dark. A moment 
of scratching later and he slipped inside. Unbuttoning his shirt and
collapsing onto the sunken bed, he sighed heavily. _What a long day_, he
thought to himself. Tilting his head to look at the source of the blue
glow in his room, he frowned. Whatever channel the television had been
on had gone out. Groping underneath his bed, he pushed aside the pieces
of clothing in search of the remote control. Despite being emersed in
news all day, he still wanted to watch some. A clatter greeted him, the 
smooth surface of hard plastic pressing into the palm of his hand as he 
curled his fingers around it. Picking randomly, he mashed in the buttons
to channel 4.

Late again. No matter how hard she tried something always seemed to come
up and need her attention. This time it had been an accident on the
highway. For whatever reason, half the populous felt the need to slow 
down and watch the various scraps of metal get cleaned off the road—even 
3 hours after the actual crash.

Pulling up alongside the white news van she shook her head and parked.
Holding her hand over the handle, she breathed out and enjoyed the small
quiet sanctuary of her car a second more. A tapping on the glass
shattering the slight respite.

"You ready to roll?" A bright lenseflair and black box peered at her
window. "Susan! Come on, channel 5's already beat us here. If you don't
want the boss on you again, hurry up!"

The light reversed and bobbed down the breakdown lane towards the
flashing blue sirens. With a groan from both her and the door, she
stepped out into the street. Her hair whipped by the traffic speeding
by, she steadied herself and began walking. The camera's light was back
on her.

"Susan!"

"Jesus, Tom, what?"

"Your shoes?"

Grumbling, Susan turned back towards her car and yanked the backdoor
open. Fishing through the empty water bottles and spare clothes until
she found a set of black pumps and hurriedly pulled them on. Fixing the
heel of the shoe as she walked back towards Tom and sighed.

"You know, it's not like they can see my feet when you've got that thing
on my face"

"Its illegal to drive without shoes, you know that. Besides those
network guys can tell"

"Bullshit they can, and that's a stupid law and you know it", fluffing
her hair and adjusting the microphone pinned to her lapel she smiled at
Tom, "how do I look?"

"Like we're not paid enough to be on the side of the road at 10:00 at
night reporting an accident that no one cares about"

"Tom..."

"You look fine Susan, can we just get this over with? My kids sick at
home and the longer I'm out the longer his mom's going to feed him
sugar", Tom adjusted the heavy camera on his shoulder and flicked a few
switches.

"James? You should have said something! I would have brought? Some soup.
I was just at the—"

"Susan..."

"Right, right. Let's roll Tom"
