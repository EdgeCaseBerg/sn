### Chapter 1

It was a rainy Monday, worst than your usual Monday by at least two 
gallons worth. With a shiver and a sigh, a body stumbled past a door 
frame and into the first story apartment on a dead end street. 
Shaking the rain from his coat and coughing he brushed himself off. 

The entryway was narrow, and the small puddles around too many shoes 
were rapidly expanding as he stood there. Hanging his coat up and 
clearing his throat some more he worked off his boots and sighed. It 
had been a long day for him; the usual suspects of his bosses long 
nose over his shoulder, the editors who could't seem to keep their 
paperwork in order, and all the various disasters that seemed to 
accompany each of his days.
