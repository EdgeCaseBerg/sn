### Chapter 1

It was a rainy Monday, worst than your usual Monday by at least two 
gallons worth. With a shiver and a sigh, a body stumbled past a door

The entryway was narrow, and the small puddles around too many shoes 
were rapidly expanding as he stood there. Hanging his coat up and

colored hair was shaggy and hung down just past his chin. Mouth slowly
chewing away at the large bite he had just taken from his sandwich. Remy
stood, waiting for him to finish his mouthful.
