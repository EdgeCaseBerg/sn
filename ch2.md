The clattering of pans and skillets being pulled from drawers startled
Remy awake. Groggily moaning and flipping over he pressed a pillow
around his head. The continuing noise of Clark's breakfast in progress
refused to let him fallback asleep and he was soon stumbling into the
bathroom.

Clark wasn't a bad guy, he just wasn't particularly aware. The number of
times he had kept Remy awake, or woke him up was probably nearing the
thousands by now, matched only by the pounds of food he had cooked
whenever he woke Remy up. It almost seemed planned sometimes; like Clark
purposely woke him up because he had made too much food or wanted to
gossip about this or that.

Remy washed off his face and finished brushing his teeth as he mulled
over his thoughts. Dwelling a little while on if Clark purposely woke
him or not before walking through the hall and into the kitchen. The
smell of oregano and cheese was strong, and the sight of two massive
omelets confirmed Remy's suspicions. Clark looked over his shoulder and
smiled. His voice shook with the rhythm of his swipes on the counter.

"Morning sunshine! Ready for breakfast?"

Remy walked up to the table and inspected the egg. "What've we got here?
Oregano and cheddar omelet?"

"Oh more than that! I folded some spinach in there. Chopped it real
fine, and mixed in the oregano, and a bit of my special ingredient",
Clark beamed proudly and hoisted a pot of coffee to the table.

Raising his eyebrow speculatively, Remy happily accepted a hot cup from
the excited chef. "Special, huh? What's the special?"

Clark's face somehow split even wider, "it's a secret, but you'll know
it when you taste it"

"How do you know I'll like it?", eyes roving the opening he had just
made with a fork, Remy watched some type of sauce leak out and shrugged.
"I haven't been disappointed by your cooking yet I guess"

Clark sat down across the table and began working on his own omelet,
heartedly chewing and sipping coffee. He pressed on Remy a little more,
eager Tudor feedback on his recipe. "It ain't going to hurt ya Remy, eat
up!"

The oregano was a powerful smell, masking whatever the sauce's odor was
with it's own spicy aroma. His fork wound with egg, cheese, and sauce he
took a bite. Smacking his lips and exhaling sharply as the taste
exploded across his tongue.

"Hot sauce?"

"Not just hot sauce!" insulted, Clark began listing the various peppers
and ingredients he had used, voice steadily climbing as he recounted the
hours he had spent selecting each item used.

"Okay! Okay! But yeah? Special hot sauce?"

He pointed at him with a fork and emphasized each word, "special hot
sauce"
