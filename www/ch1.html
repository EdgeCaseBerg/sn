gallons worth. With a shiver and a sigh, a body stumbled past a door 
frame and into the first story apartment on a dead end street. 
Shaking the rain from his coat and coughing he brushed himself off. </p>
<p>The entryway was narrow, and the small puddles around too many shoes 
were rapidly expanding as he stood there. Hanging his coat up and 
clearing his throat, he worked off his boots and sighed. It 
had been a long day for him; the usual suspects of his bosses long 
nose over his shoulder, the editors who could&#39;t seem to keep their 
paperwork in order, and all the various disasters that seemed to 
accompany each of his days.</p>
<p>Exiting the hallway he walked through his kitchen, waving towards 
the back of his flatmates head. Hoping that he wouldn&#39;t—</p>
<p>&quot;You have the rent today, Remy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s Monday Clark, you know I get paid Fridays, just like everyone 
else&quot;, he paused in his step and leaned back into the frame of the 
door. &quot;Rent&#39;s not due until the end of week anyway, why&#39;re you on 
my case about it?&quot; </p>
<p>Clark had turned to face him, his hands clasping a large sub leaking
vinegar and an italian-looking assortment of meats and greens. His corn
colored hair was shaggy and hung down just past his chin. Mouth slowly
chewing away at the large bite he had just taken from his sandwich. Remy
stood, impatiently waiting for him to finish his mouthful. </p>
<p>&quot;Cause&quot;, he sniffed, &quot;last time you were late&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I won&#39;t be this time, I&#39;ve got a good story written already and the boss 
promised me the usual plus a little extra&quot;. Remy pushed off from the door&#39;s
frame and spun away. Walking down the hallway as Clark muttered something 
incoherent, but likely offensive. </p>
<p>Navigating the narrow path through bundles of newspapers, books, and 
shelves, Remy fumbled with the key to his room in the dark. A moment 
of scratching later and he slipped inside. Unbuttoning his shirt and
collapsing onto the sunken bed, he sighed heavily. <em>What a long day</em>, he
thought to himself. Tilting his head to look at the source of the blue
glow in his room, he frowned. Whatever channel the television had been
on had gone out. </p>
<p>Remy shifted up in his seat, pretending his best to be part vegetable.
But soon enough the quiet was ringing in his ears, and he was pulling
out the desk chair. Settling into the wooden frame and shuffling papers
in search of a pen. A lot of people he knew wrote from their couches,
from beds, or some comfortable soft space — Not Remy.</p>
<p>His hard wooden chair was old, straight backed, and above all: kept him
awake while he worked. Pen to paper he started drafting the rough
outline of a column. It wasn&#39;t a front-pager but it certainly would make
it close. As much as his boss hated local news, the old fogey had to
have some of it or he&#39;d be catching hell from his wife. Remy smiled, the
day that woman had chewed out his boss in the office had been hilarious.
Mentioning it in office was a death sentence, but in the safety of his
home? The combination of job security and amusement picked him up better
than any drink. Grin in hand he continued writing, moving past the
outline stage to sorting his notes and writing.</p>
<p>By the end of the hour his article was ready for editing — and he was
ready for a break. Folding his papers carefully and slipping them into a
manilla folder, he stood and stretched before poking his head out into
the hallway. It was dark and there wasn&#39;t any light coming from the
kitchen. Holding his breath and listening he could just barely make out
feint snoring from the other room.</p>
<p>The refrigerator in the kitchen was full of random leftovers and plastic
containers of ingredients. A result of Clark&#39;s job as a chef, they never
ran out of food. Remy wasn&#39;t sure how, but nearly everyday Clark brought
home some dish or &quot;spoiled&quot; meal from the high-end restaurant Cliff &amp;
Clark&#39;s. Perks of being an owner he guessed, the food was always perfectly 
fine to eat, but the rich upper class needed everything absolutely fresh 
it seemed. <em>All the same, more for me</em>, he thought as he fixed up a large 
sandwich. Chewing thoughtfully, he retreated back to his room and sank 
onto his bed once more.</p>
<p>Groping underneath, he pushed aside the pieces of clothing in search of 
the remote control. Despite being emersed in news all day, he still wanted 
to watch some. A clatter greeted him, the smooth surface of hard plastic 
pressing into the palm of his hand as he curled his fingers around it. 
Picking randomly, he mashed on the buttons and channel 5 news sprang into 
life on his screen.</p>
<hr>

<p>Late again. No matter how hard she tried something always seemed to come
up and need her attention. This time it had been an accident on the
highway. For whatever reason, half the populous felt the need to slow 
down and watch the various scraps of metal get cleaned off the road—even 
3 hours after the actual crash.</p>
<p>Pulling up alongside the white news van she shook her head and parked.
Holding her hand over the handle, she breathed out and enjoyed the small
quiet sanctuary of her car a second more. A tapping on the glass
shattering the slight respite.</p>
<p>&quot;You ready to roll?&quot; A bright lenseflair and black box peered at her
window. &quot;Susan! Come on, channel 5&#39;s already beat us here. If you don&#39;t
want the boss on you again, hurry up!&quot;</p>
<p>The light reversed and bobbed down the breakdown lane towards the
flashing blue sirens. With a groan from both her and the door, she
stepped out into the street. Her hair whipped by the traffic speeding
by, she steadied herself and began walking. The camera&#39;s light was back
on her.</p>
<p>&quot;Susan!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus, Tom, what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your shoes?&quot;</p>
<p>Grumbling, Susan turned back towards her car and yanked the backdoor
open. Fishing through the empty water bottles and spare clothes until
she found a set of black pumps and hurriedly pulled them on. Fixing the
heel of the shoe as she walked back towards Tom and sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, it&#39;s not like they can see my feet when you&#39;ve got that thing
on my face&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Its illegal to drive without shoes, you know that. Besides those
network guys can tell&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bullshit they can, and that&#39;s a stupid law and you know it&quot;, fluffing
her hair and adjusting the microphone pinned to her lapel she smiled at
Tom, &quot;how do I look?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like we&#39;re not paid enough to be on the side of the road at 10:00 at
night reporting an accident that no one cares about&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tom...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look fine Susan, can we just get this over with? My kids sick at
home and the longer I&#39;m out the longer his mom&#39;s going to feed him
sugar&quot;, Tom adjusted the heavy camera on his shoulder and flicked a few
switches.</p>
<p>&quot;James? You should have said something! I would have brought? Some soup.
I was just at the—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Susan...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, right. Let&#39;s roll Tom&quot;</p>
<hr>

<p>Stan stood behind the bar with his arms crossed, his eyes scanning the
bar for empty drinks while he maintained half an intelligent
conversation with the 2 slumped over drunkards. At the sound of the bell
swinging on the door he looked up and saw Susan walk in. Smiling, he
waved her over and straightened his tie.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;ll it be miss?&quot;</p>
<p>Susan grinned, &quot;miss? When&#39;d we get so formal Stan?&quot;</p>
<p>Stan pulled out an empty glass and a couple whiskey stones, continuing
to chat while he poured Jamesons into it, &quot;this is a classy bar Susan,
you know I&#39;ve got to keep it professional, even if I know what you&#39;re
drinking already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one calls me miss except the little kids we interview on feel-good
clips&quot;, taking a sip from the glass in front of her, she shivered as the
warmth hit her belly, &quot;that hits the spot Stan, thanks&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you on the tube an hour ago, mighty awful looking accident&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you think I&#39;m here? If I tried to sleep after seeing what the
clean up crews were dealing with I&#39;d have nightmares.&quot; She reached down
and peeled off her shoes, &quot;worst part is that I have to stand there in
heels.&quot;</p>
<p>Chuckling, Stan shook his head and filled a glass with water. &quot;I see
plenty of women in heels dancing to flamenco on our Spanish themed
nights, how is it you can&#39;t stand them for the 5 minutes it takes to
talk to a camera?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those girls are freaks of nature Stan, its not really that the shoes
hurt, its just wearing shoes in general.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those <em>freaks</em> know how to dance and have fun, how come I never see you
on our dancing nights? You&#39;re only ever here after everyone&#39;s left.&quot;</p>
<p>Susan drained the last of her drink and rubbed her forehead.  Giving
Stan a crooked half smile, &quot;obviously because I just love your company.&quot;</p>
<p>A bemused look on his face, Stan folded his arms, &quot;you only say that for
free drinks&quot;, he leaned in, &quot;inventory&#39;s tonight, so that&#39;s not going to
work.&quot;</p>
<p>Pouting, Susan used the straw to push the stones around in her glass,
feigning a sigh and batting her eyelashes at her friend. &quot;Pleeeeaase? I
saw some rough shit tonight Stan, I need this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one needs alcohol darling, trust me, you&#39;ll have worse nightmares
after getting red in the face. I&#39;ve seen some terrible things here
before and made that mistake.&quot; Stan finished cleaning a wine glass and
hung it up, glancing over to see Susan&#39;s frown. </p>
<p>Susan sighed and held up her glass, &quot;fine, give me one more and I&#39;ll pay
up, but you have to walk me home&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do that, just let me kick the regulars out first&quot;. Moving to each
slouched and drowsing member of the bar, Stan slowly collected his tips,
checks, and glasses from the counter. By the time Susan had finished her
drink, he was in the middle of scanning bottles and writing down amounts
onto a legal pad. A half hour later he was walked a slightly tipsy Susan
to her apartment.</p></section></body></html>
